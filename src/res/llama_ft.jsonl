{"title": "Minimum Cost of Buying Candies With Discount", "prompt": "Solve the following Leetcode problem in Python: \nA shop is selling candies at a discount. For **every two** candies sold, the shop gives a **third** candy for **free**.\n\nThe customer can choose **any** candy to take away for free as long as the cost of the chosen candy is less than or equal to the **minimum** cost of the two candies bought.\n\n*   For example, if there are `4` candies with costs `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`, and the customer buys candies with costs `2` and `3`, they can take the candy with cost `1` for free, but not the candy with cost `4`.\n\nGiven a **0-indexed** integer array `cost`, where `cost[i]` denotes the cost of the `ith` candy, return _the **minimum cost** of buying **all** the candies_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** cost = \\[1,2,3\\]\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** We buy the candies with costs 2 and 3, and take the candy with cost 1 for free.\nThe total cost of buying all candies is 2 + 3 = 5. This is the **only** way we can buy the candies.\nNote that we cannot buy candies with costs 1 and 3, and then take the candy with cost 2 for free.\nThe cost of the free candy has to be less than or equal to the minimum cost of the purchased candies.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** cost = \\[6,5,7,9,2,2\\]\n**Output:** 23\n**Explanation:** The way in which we can get the minimum cost is described below:\n- Buy candies with costs 9 and 7\n- Take the candy with cost 6 for free\n- We buy candies with costs 5 and 2\n- Take the last remaining candy with cost 2 for free\nHence, the minimum cost to buy all candies is 9 + 7 + 5 + 2 = 23.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** cost = \\[5,5\\]\n**Output:** 10\n**Explanation:** Since there are only 2 candies, we buy both of them. There is not a third candy we can take for free.\nHence, the minimum cost to buy all candies is 5 + 5 = 10.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= cost.length <= 100`\n*   `1 <= cost[i] <= 100`", "output":
